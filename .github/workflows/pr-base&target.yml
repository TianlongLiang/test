  # his event runs in the context of the base of the pull request, rather than in the context of the merge commit, as the pull_request event does.
  # This prevents execution of unsafe code from the head of the pull request that could alter your repository or steal any secrets you use in your workflow.
  # This event allows your workflow to do things like label or comment on pull requests from forks.
  # Avoid using this event if you need to build or run code from the pull request.
  pull_request_target:
    # When a pull request merges, the pull request is automatically closed.
    # To run a workflow when a pull request merges, use the pull_request_target closed event type along with 
    # a conditional that checks the merged value of the event. For example, the following workflow will run whenever a pull request closes.
    # The if_merged job will only run if the pull request was also merged.
    types:
      - closed
  # allow to be triggered manually
